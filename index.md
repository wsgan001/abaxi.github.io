I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, at The Ohio State University](https://cse.osu.edu/), working with [Professor Kannan Srinivasan](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~athreya.14/) as a part of the [CoSyNe group](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~athreya.14/cosyne/Publications.htm).

I'm interested in the application of machine learning to problems in wireless communication. I have also worked on problems in network/graph mining, and text mining. Before joining OSU, I received my MS in [Computer Science from the University Of Cincinnati](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/electrical-engineering-computer-science.html).
